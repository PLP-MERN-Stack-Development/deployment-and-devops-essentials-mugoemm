# Uptime Monitoring

We recommend using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) or [Better Uptime](https://betteruptime.com/) to monitor your backend and frontend URLs.

- Add your `/health` endpoint (e.g., `https://your-backend-url/health`) to your monitor.
- Set up alerts for downtime.
- Document your monitor URLs and alert contacts here.
