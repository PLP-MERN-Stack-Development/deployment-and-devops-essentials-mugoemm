# Performance Monitoring

For advanced performance monitoring, consider integrating:
- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)
- [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
- [Sentry Performance](https://sentry.io/for/performance-monitoring/)

These tools can track API response times, error rates, and user experience metrics.

Document your setup and dashboard URLs here after integration.
